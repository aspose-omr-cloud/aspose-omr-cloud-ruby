# Aspose.OMR for Cloud

[Aspose.OMR for Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/cloud) is a REST API that helps you to perform optical mark recognition in the cloud. We provide a series of [SDKs](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud). Along with that, you can get [binaries](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases) to start working immediately and recognize various OMR forms.

Developers can embed [optical recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mark_recognition) in any type of application to extract data from images of tests, exams, questionnaires, surveys, etc. In the repository you can find examples on how to start using [Aspose.OMR API](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/omrcloud/OMR+API+Specification) in your project.

## Quickstart

You can perform tasks out of the box without writing a single line of code with our [GUI client](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases). You can also refer to the [client documentation](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/omrcloud/Aspose.OMR.Client+Application).

## Using OMR Cloud API in your Ruby projects

This SDK is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: 1.1
- Package version: 18.8.0
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.RubyClientCodegen

## Requirements
Ruby 2.3 and later

## Installation

### Build a gem

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build aspose_omr_cloud.gemspec
```

Then either install the gem locally:

```shell
gem install ./aspose_omr_cloud-18.8.0.gem
```
(for development, run `gem install --dev ./aspose_omr_cloud-18.8.0.gem` to install the development dependencies)

or publish the gem to a gem hosting service, e.g. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

    gem 'aspose_omr_cloud', '~> 18.8.0'

### Install from Git

If the Ruby gem is hosted at a git repository: https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-ruby, then add the following in the Gemfile:

    gem 'aspose_omr_cloud', :git => 'https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-ruby.git'

### Include the Ruby code directly

Include the Ruby code directly using `-I` as follows:

```shell
ruby -Ilib script.rb
```

## Optional requirements

To take full advantage of Aspose.OMR for Cloud, _aspose/storage-sdk-ruby_ is required. Just run `gem install aspose_storage_cloud`. You may refer to official [Aspose Storage SDK](https://github.com/aspose-storage-cloud/aspose-storage-cloud-ruby) to get more information.

## Usage

### Receive Cloud Keys
Aspose.Cloud credentials are required to use Aspose.OMR for Cloud API. You can acquire App SID and App Key by registrating at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud). It will take only a couple of minutes.

### Code example
You can check out [OMR Demo](demo) project to get started with Aspose.OMR for Cloud.
